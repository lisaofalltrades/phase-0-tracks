// Pseudocode a function that takes a string as a parameter and reverses the string.

// 1. The string is passed into the function
// 2. Each character is iterated though the string and the character is given an index value of the length of the total string, 
// minus the index value
// 3. The string is then reassembled based off of the index value for each character
