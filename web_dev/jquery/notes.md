How to approach learning jQuery

Find beginner resources that look like they will provide enough information to keep me busy for 2 hours
While studying these resources, code a long with the examples as much as possible to commit them to memory.
After every example try your own example or try to play with the code given to break it or use it in an interesting way - and understand WHY it did what it did.
Don't take a break as long as you find the material stimulating and engaging. If this isn't working find an alternative resource, and if that doesn't work, take a short break.
Do not gloss over a topic that you do not understand simply because you think it won't be relevant. Put all of these topics in a file to refer to later if it's taking too much time now.
Stop and think about applications this will have for your own projects and interests before moving onto the next topic.
