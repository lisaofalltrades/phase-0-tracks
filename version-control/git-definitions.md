# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to view the entire hustory of revisions. It's useful because you can see where mistakes were made or if you change your mind you can go back to an older version. It's also useful to see who made the changes.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch in Git gives you a "copy" of your project to work on. It is useful because it allowes multiple developers to work on a prokect at once. Once merged, all copies will be synced.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point for the project. A commit message is clear and descriptive. It describes the save point for future reference.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two branches have changed the same part of the same file and those branches are merged together. To avoid this, team memebrs should clearly define roles & responsibilities to avoid duplication of work.
