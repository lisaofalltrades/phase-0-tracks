#Pseudocode
#Split name at spaces, reverse items in array, and rejoin
#Split name into characters
#map each character to next vowel or consonant using get_next method
# - if character is not a letter, return the character without changing it
# - check whether vowel or consonant and map to next vowel or consonant accordingly
